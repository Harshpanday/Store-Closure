Order in which scripts should be run:
1. data.py
2. agent.py
3. main.py
4. server.py
5. run.py

Notes:
The CSV file practice_data has 30,000 agents representing different households. In the the file data.py (line 7) I have dropped most 
of the data so that the model works properly,as the model is not that stable with large number of agents (>7k). But you can try
to change that line and add more agents to see how the model runs on TAPIS with a large number of agents.
